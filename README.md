# Instafilter
Project 13 of 100 days of SwiftUI from https://www.hackingwithswift.com/.

* Well commented. Generally meets the project as described by @twostraws with some changes as 
I dug further in. I did not add any extra filters but built an infrastructure to make adding
them easy as well as specifying the inputs they support and custom ranges for each input on
each filter.

* Focus on separating data from views. Focus on using enum feature of swift. Encapsulated core
image handling in a single class, which also hides UIKit interactions from the swiftui part of
the application.
